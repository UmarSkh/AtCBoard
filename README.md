## Lessons Learned

This project was a rapid learning curve. I mastered Next.js fundamentals, web scraping techniques, and deployment workflows. Robust debugging and server management became essential skills. Tailwind CSS and TypeScript solidified my frontend capabilities, improving both efficiency and design. Future exploration of Firebase and authentication will expand upon this now solid foundation.
