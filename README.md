# AtCoder Board

AtCoder Board solves the problem of scattered and lost rough work during coding practice. It links each problem with a persistent digital scratchpad, keeping your visual thought process in one place. This maintains a reliable archive of practised problems and simulates the structured problem-solving environment of technical interviews.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a rapid learning curve. I mastered Next.js fundamentals, web scraping techniques, and deployment workflows, all while utilizing Firebase for its database capabilities and implementing robust authentication. Essential skills like debugging and server management became second nature. My front-end capabilities were solidified by Tailwind CSS, leading to improved efficiency and design, while TypeScript enhanced code quality and maintainability across the project.
