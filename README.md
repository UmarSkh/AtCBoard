## Lessons Learned

This project was a rapid learning curve. I mastered Next.js fundamentals, web scraping techniques, and deployment workflows. Robust debugging and server management became essential skills. Tailwind CSS and TypeScript solidified my front-end capabilities, improving both efficiency and design. Future exploration of Firebase and authentication will expand upon this now-solid foundation.
