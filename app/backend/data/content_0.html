<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In AtCoder city, there are five antennas standing in a straight line. They are called Antenna <var>A, B, C, D</var> and <var>E</var> from west to east, and their coordinates are <var>a, b, c, d</var> and <var>e</var>, respectively.<br>
Two antennas can communicate directly if the distance between them is <var>k</var> or less, and they cannot if the distance is greater than <var>k</var>.<br>
Determine if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate <strong>directly</strong>.<br>
Here, assume that the distance between two antennas at coordinates <var>p</var> and <var>q</var> (<var>p &lt; q</var>) is <var>q - p</var>.  </p>
