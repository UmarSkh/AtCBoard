<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>Yay!
</pre>

<p>In this case, there is no pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the distance between <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> is <var>2 - 1</var> = <var>1</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>A</var> and <var>C</var> is <var>4 - 1</var> = <var>3</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>A</var> and <var>D</var> is <var>8 - 1</var> = <var>7</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>A</var> and <var>E</var> is <var>9 - 1</var> = <var>8</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>B</var> and <var>C</var> is <var>4 - 2</var> = <var>2</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>B</var> and <var>D</var> is <var>8 - 2</var> = <var>6</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>B</var> and <var>E</var> is <var>9 - 2</var> = <var>7</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>C</var> and <var>D</var> is <var>8 - 4</var> = <var>4</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>C</var> and <var>E</var> is <var>9 - 4</var> = <var>5</var></li>
<li>the distance between <var>D</var> and <var>E</var> is <var>9 - 8</var> = <var>1</var></li>
</ul>
<p>and none of them is greater than <var>15</var>. Thus, the correct output is <code>Yay!</code>.</p>
